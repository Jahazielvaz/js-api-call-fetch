DEFINITIONS
Function Expressions: instead of directly naming the function you create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable name, and that's what's known as a function expression.
Passing Functions Through Other Functions: You can pass one function as a parameter and execute it within the current function


STOCK METHODS
__filename : Returns the name of the current file that's being invoked
__dirname : Returns the name of the current directory that's being invoked
setTimeout() : Just like in JS returns the given result based on a specified time
setInterval() : Just like in JS returns the given result based on a looped timer
clearInterval() : Standard JS
